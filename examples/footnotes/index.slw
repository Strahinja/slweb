# Footnotes

Footnotes can be added by using the syntax `[^id]` and later `[^id]: Footnote
text`[^justlike].

You can thus minimize the amount of extra markup present in the text
itself[^links].

[^justlike]: Just like this!
[^links]: Similar to links. Footnotes themselves 
          can contain **some** `markup`, and can be broken up into 
          multiple lines.
