# Parse warning

If the input contains both inline and regular footnotes, **slweb** will issue a
warning to `stderr`^[So this warning won't appear in the output.].

The numbering of the footnotes will most likely overlap[^A] (hence the warning),
but the anchors will be unique, having `inline-` prepended to the _id_ for
inline footnotes.

[^A]: As evident in this example.
