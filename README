                                     =====

Slweb is a static website generator which aims at being simplistic. It
transforms custom Markdown-like syntax into HTML.


				 Prerequisites
				 -------------

Aside from the obvious (GCC and GNU make), slweb requires groff(1) and gzip(1)
to create and compress documentation. git(1) is, aside from cloning the
repository, required to use the directive {git-log}.


                                    Install
                                    -------

$ git clone https://github.com/Strahinja/slweb.git
$ cd slweb
$ make && sudo make install


                                    Examples
                                    --------

See the examples/ directory in this repository.

NOTE: Since the migration to C, not all of the features of bash/sed-based slweb
are yet ported, so not all of the examples work as intended. This is still a
WIP, see the file TODO for more details.
