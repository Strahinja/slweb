                                     =====

Slweb is a static website generator which aims at being simplistic. It
transforms custom Markdown-like syntax into HTML.


                                 Prerequisites
                                 -------------

Aside from the obvious (GCC), slweb requires realpath(1) to determine paths in
local links and groff(1) and gzip(1) to create and compress documentation.
git(1) is, aside from cloning the repository, required to use the directive
{git-log}.


                                    Install
                                    -------

$ git clone https://github.com/Strahinja/slweb.git
$ cd slweb
$ su

    Then, if you have djb redo:

# redo install

    if you don't:

# ./do install
