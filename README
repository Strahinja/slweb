			       **IMPORTANT NOTE**
			       ==================

Version v0.2.8-beta is the last version of slweb using sed. I decided to switch
to C because of the limitation of sed(1) when used to parse the entire file as a
single string (the -z option), as listed in

    https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/manual/sed.html#Limitations

    > For those who want to write portable sed scripts, be aware that some

    > 8192 byte line lengths.  GNU sed has no built-in limit on line length;
    > as long as it can malloc() more (virtual) memory, you can feed or

When processed through slweb, some of the test pages using the cyrillic text in
UTF-8 would be rendered incorrectly, even when using GNU sed. I suspect this is
the result of the mentioned limitation.

    The next version of slweb is going to be written in C from scratch and
labeled v0.3.0.

                                     =====

Slweb is a static website generator which aims at being simplistic. It uses
sed(1) to transform a custom Markdown-like syntax into HTML.
