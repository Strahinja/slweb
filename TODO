    [~] Add csv templating directive

        [x] Move fprintf(output...) to a separate function

        [ ] Record that function's output rom {csv}..{/csv} into 
            "capture blocks" - no need to do that for all of them,
            only the last one

        [ ] Open CSV, for each row in CSV skipping the first one
            output the current capture block substituting the variable
            escapes $1..$9 (keeping it simple with 1-digit) with row fields
