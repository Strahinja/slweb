.SH REFERENCE
.
.LP
Files processed by
.B slweb
are using a minimal subset of Markdown with added directives.  
.
.SS Supported Markdown features
.
.IP \[bu] 4
.BR Backticks .
Text inside \fC`backticks`\fP will be put inside \fC<code></code>\fP. Text
surrounded by triple backticks (\fC```\fP) on the lines by themselves will be
put inside \fC<pre></pre>\fP. Any \[lq]less-than\[rq] character inside backticks
will be converted to \fC&lt;\fP. Any text following the first triple backticks
until the end of the line will be ignored. This is to account for language
highlighting specification, which isn't yet supported.
.
.IP \[bu]
.BR Blockquotes .
Starting the line with \fC>\fP will surround it with a \fC<blockquote>\fP tag.
Multiple lines are supported.
.
.IP \[bu]
.BR Bold/italic .
Text inside \fC*asterisks*\fP or \fC_underlines_\fP will be put inside
\fC<em></em>\fP. Text inside \fC**double asterisks**\fP or \fC__double
underlines__\fP will be put inside \fC<strong></strong>\fP. \fC***More than
two*** of the ___same symbol___\fP should be avoided.
.
.IP \[bu]
.BR "Footnotes (regular and inline)" .
Two-part regular footnotes can be added in a manner similar to links (see
.BR Links ). 
Inline footnotes are also supported.
.
.RS
.IP \- 4
.B Regular footnotes
have two mandatory parts: first, the footnote mark is represented by
\fC[^\f[CI]footnoteid\f[CR]]\fR, where
.I footnoteid
is the footnote identifier. Second, the text of the footnote is represented by
\fC[^\f[CI]footnoteid\f[CR]]: \f[CI]sometext\fR, with
.I sometext
being the text of the footnote. Footnote text construct needs to begin at the
start of a line, and it is the most practical to have it placed near the bottom
of the file, similar to normal links.
.
.IP ""
Combined, the input:
.CDS 8
This is a text[^first].

[^first]: With a footnote!
.CDE
.
.IP "" 4
gives (some lines are wrapped for this manual):
.
.CDS 8
<p>This is a text<a href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-text-1">
<sup>1</sup></a>.</p>

<hr />
<p id="footnote-1"><a href="#footnote-text-1">1.</a>  
With a footnote!</p>
.CDE
.
.IP \- 4
.B Inline footnotes
can be added by using the construct \fC^[footnotetext]\fP. For example, input
.
.CDS 8
Inline footnote^[Footnote text needs to fit on a line!] in a
paragraph.
.CDE
.
.IP "" 
will produce
.
.CDS 8
Inline footnote<a href="#inline-footnote-1" 
id="inline-footnote-text-1"><sup>1</sup></a> in a
paragraph.
<hr />
<p id="inline-footnote-1"><a href="#inline-footnote-text-1">
1.</a> Footnote text needs to fit on a line!</p>
.CDE
.RE
.
.IP
The horizontal rule and the list of footnotes is output only once, before the
end of
.SM HTML
document body. Rule and the list of footnotes can be surrounded by a div with
the \[lq]\fCfootnotes\fP\[rq] id by setting the
.SM YAML
variable
.I add-footnote-div
to \[lq]1\[rq] (see
.BR add-footnote-div ).
.
.IP
Inline and regular footnotes can be used at the same time, but they don't share
the numbering. This doesn't affect functionality, but it does affect
presentation, as some footnote numbers will overlap. As a result, whenever
.B slweb
encounters both footnote types in the same document, a warning will be issued to
.IR stderr .
.
.IP \[bu]
.BR Headings .
A line starting with \fC#\fP followed by space will be put inside
\fC<h?></h?>\fP, where \fC?\fP stands for 1-4, depending on the number of
hash signs.
.
.IP \[bu]
.BR "Horizontal rules" .
Three dashes at the start of the line will produce a \fC<hr />\fP in the output.
As this Markdown feature clashes with
.SM YAML
block boundaries, it will work only if
.SM YAML
block is present in the input and before the three dashes for the horizontal
rule. Any text following the three dashes on the same line will be ignored.
.
.IP
Alternatively, three asterisks (\fC***\fP) can be used instead of dashes,
avoiding the necessity for a
.SM YAML
block preceding the asterisks.
.
.IP \[bu]
.BR Images .
Similar to links (see
.BR Links ), 
images can be added by using:
.
.CDS 8
![Some title](/path/to/image.png)
.CDE
.
.IP
Which will produce:
.
.CDS 8
<figure>
<a href="/path/to/image.png" title="Some title" class="image"
  target="_blank"><img src="/path/to/image.png" alt="Some title" 
  /></a><figcaption>Some title</figcaption>
</figure>
.CDE
.
.IP
As with links, a form similar to the \[lq]regular form\[rq] of links can also be
used, using the image id instead of the direct
.SM URL.
.
.IP
If the additional link or \fC<figure>\fP/\fC<figcaption>\fP tags are not
desirable, they can be turned off by setting
.B add-image-links
and
.B add-figcaption
to \[lq]0\[rq].
.
.IP \[bu]
.BR "Keyboard tags" .
Text inside \fC||double bars||\fP will be put inside \fC<kbd></kbd>\fP tags. As
with backticks, any \[lq]less-than\[rq] character will be converted to
\fC&lt;\fP.
.
.IP \[bu]
.BR "Line breaks" .
Two spaces followed by a newline will become \fC<br />\fP.
.
.IP \[bu]
.BR Links .
.
.RS
.IP \- 4
.BR "Inline links" .
The construct \fC[A link](https://example.com)\fP will be converted into \fC<a
href="https://example.com">A link</a>\fP.
.
.IP ""
Special case is the form \fC[=somemacro Link title](https://anything)\fP which
prepends the body of a macro
.I somemacro
into the \fC<a></a>\fP tag (here broken into multiple lines for clarity):
.
.CDS 8
<a href="https://anything">
<!-- contents of somemacro -->
Link title</a>
.CDE
.
.IP "" 4
This can, for example, be used to add
.SM SVG
icons to links. See
.BR Macros .
.
.IP "" 4
Also, the form \fC[(Link title)](http://asite.com)\fP will surround the link
title (text between \fC<a></a>\fP tags) with \fC<span></span>\fP, like so:
.
.CDS 8
<a href="http://asite.com"><span>Link title</span></a>
.CDE
.
.IP
This allows for separate styling of link text. It can be combined with the
macro-form:
.
.CDS 8
[=somemacro (Link title)](http://asite.com)
.CDE
.
.IP
It will prepend the body of a macro
.I somemacro
outside of the \fC<span></span>\fP:
.
.CDS 8
<a href="http://asite.com">
<!-- contents of somemacro -->
<span>Link title</span></a>
.CDE
.
.IP \-
.BR "Regular links" .
Everything said about inline links applies to regular links, with the exception
that instead of the parenthesized
.SM URL,
link text inside brackets will be followed by link id (different than the
\[lq]\fCid\fP\[rq]
.IR attribute! )
inside brackets, and a
separate definition of that link id is needed, usually near the end of input.
.
.IP
For example:
.
.CDS 8
Here's a link to [my website][mw].

[mw]: https://mysite.com
.CDE
.
.IP
will produce:
.
.CDS 8
<p>Here's a link to <a href="https://mysite.com">my 
website</a>.</p>
.CDE
.
.IP
This can help reduce the amount of code in the text of the page.
.RE
.
.IP \[bu] 4
.BR Lists .
Lines starting with a dash (\fC\-\fP) will start an unordered list (if used for
the first time) and start a list item. Input:
.
.CDS 8
Colors are:

- Red
- Green
- Blue

and so on.
.CDE
.
.IP
will produce:
.
.CDS 8
<p>Colors are:</p>

<ul>

</li></ul>
<p>And so on.</p>
.CDE
.
.IP
Indenting a line after a blank line with four spaces will create a paragraph
within the list item, otherwise it will end the list:
.
.CDS 8
- This is a text inside a list item.

    Remarkably, this paragraph is as well.
- This is already a second item.

This is after the list.
.CDE
.
.IP
will produce:
.
.CDS 8
<ul>
<li><p>This is a text inside a list item.</p>
<p>Remarkably, this paragraph is as well.
</p></li>
<li><p>This is already a second item.</p></li></ul>
<p>This is after the list.</p>
.CDE
.
.IP \[bu] 4
.BR Paragraphs .
Text surrounded by newlines will be put inside \fC<p></p>\fP tags. See
.SM "KNOWN LIMITATIONS."
.
.SS Math mode
.
.LP
Math mode is supported through KaTeX. With
.BR katex
installed, anything between dollar signs (\fC$\fP) will be transformed into
MathML and 
.SM HTML 
markup. To generate display math, use double dollar signs (\fC$$\fP). The text
between the dollar signs in both cases should be LaTeX source code, and is
passed to
.BR katex .
The KaTeX stylesheet is not included, and needs to be included separately
through the
.B stylesheet
.SM YAML
variable (see
.BR stylesheet ).
.
.SS Directives
.
.IP \[bu] 4
.BR "Brand \[lq]watermark\[rq]" .
Directive \fC{made-by}\fP is converted into a div with the id \fCmade-by\fP
containing the \[lq]watermark\[rq] text and a link to the
.B slweb
home page.
.
.IP \[bu]
.BR "CSV templating" .
Directive \fC{csv "csvfile"}{/csv}\fP marks a template. Whatever is between
\fC{csv}\fP and \fC{/csv}\fP will be processed by
.B slweb
and collected as a template. Afterwards, file \fIcsvfile.csv\fP will be read and
for each of its lines the collected template will be output, substituting each
occurence of a register mark \fC$\f[CI]n\fR (where \fIn\fP is between 1 and 9,
inclusive) with the corresponding 
.SM CSV 
field of the read line.
.SM CSV
file needs to use semicolons (;) or commas (,) as delimiters (or set
.B csv-delimiter 
as a
.SM YAML
variable in the calling
.I .slw
file) and double quotation marks (") as field boundaries. First line in the
.SM CSV
file is parsed as a header and associated with register marks \fC$#1\fP to
\fC$#9\fP.  The symbol $ is represented as \fC$$\fP. Consequently, math modes
(both inline and display) cannot be used within templates.
.
.IP "" 8
Parts of the template can be conditionally rendered by using the construct:
.
.CDS 8
$?\f[CI]n\fP
    <!-- code to include if $\f[CI]n\fC nonempty -->
$?!
    <!-- code to include if $\f[CI]n\fC empty -->
$?/
.CDE
.
.IP "" 4
where \fIn\fP is between 1 and 9, inclusive.  For example, having a file
\fIsales.csv\fP:
.
.CDS 8
"Item";"Q1 2020";"Q2 2020";"Q3 2020";"Q4 2020"
"Toothpick";"15.2";"12";"";"10"
"Teapot";"1.2";"";"5";"3.5"
.CDE
.
.IP "" 4
We can write
.
.CDS 8
{csv "sales"}
{.sales-segment}
$#1 {q}$1{/q} sales by quarter for the last year in 
thousands of units sold (for $$) were as follows:
$?2{.q1}$2{/.q1}$?!{.q1 na}N/A{/.q1}$?/ 
$?3{.q2}$3{/.q2}$?!{.q2 na}N/A{/.q2}$?/
$?4{.q3}$4{/.q3}$?!{.q3 na}N/A{/.q3}$?/

directives can't be nested and doing so will produce an error.
.

.BR "General tags" .
Directive \fC{sometag}{/sometag}\fP will be transformed into
\fC<sometag></sometag>\fP.
.
.RS
.IP \- 4
.BR "Class attributes" .
Directive \fC{tag.myclass mysecondclass}{/tag}\fP will be transformed into
\fC<tag class="myclass mysecondclass"></tag>\fP. Only one class attribute is
permitted per tag directive (subsequent dots will be inserted as part of the
\fCclass\fP attribute), but you can include multiple classes by separating them
with a space, just like in
.SM HTML,
and you can have both a class attribute and an id attribute per tag.

A variation of this is to use a special form \fC{.myclass}{/.myclass}\fP, which
will be transformed into \fC<div class="myclass"></div>\fP.
.
.IP \-
.BR "Id attributes" .
Directive \fC{tag#myid}{/tag}\fP will be transformed into \fC<tag
id="myid"></tag>\fP. Only one id attribute is permitted per tag directive
(subsequent hash signs will be included as part of the \fCid\fP attribute), and
you can have both an id attribute and a class attribute per tag.

A variation of this is to use a special form \fC{#myid}{/#myid}\fP, which will
be transformed into \fC<div id="myid"></div>\fP.
.RE
.
.IP \[bu]
.BR Includes .
Directive \fC{include "somefile"}\fP will fork, parse
.I somefile.slw
(related to
.IR basedir )
and output the resulting
.SM HTML
as if the option \fC\-\-body\-only\fP was specified. All macros and
.SM YAML
variables will be preserved.
.
.IP \[bu]
.BR Macros .
Macros can be declared using the directive \fC{=macroname}{/=macroname}\fP,
where
.I macroname
is the name of the macro. Anything between those two tags will then become the
body of a macro. Whenever \fC{=macroname}\fP is subsequently encountered in the
file, it will be replaced by the macro body. Macro definitions can't be nested
nor can they contain macro calls, and doing so will produce an error.
.
.IP \[bu]
.BR "Previous Git commit information" .
Directive \fC{git-log}\fP is converted into a div with the id \fCgit-log\fP
containing the information about the previous commit (as having information
about the current commit would be impossible).
.
.IP \[bu]
.BR "Subdirectory inclusion (blogging directive)" .
The command \fC{incdir "\fIdirname\fC" \fInum\fC =\fImacroname\fC}\fP
.RI ( num
and
.I macroname
are optional) will be expanded as follows:
.
.RS
.nr list 1 1
.IP \n[list]. 4
A \fC<ul class="incdir">\fP tag will be inserted into the document instead of
the directive.
.
.IP \n+[list].
For every subdirectory of
.IR dirname , 
relative to current directory and up to
.I num
(if present) or 5 (if omitted) total subdirectories, a \fC<li>\fP
tag will be inserted into the \fCul\fP tag.
.
.IP \n+[list].
A \fC<details>\fP tag will be inserted into each \fC<li>\fP tag.
.
.IP \n+[list].
Inside the \fC<details>\fP tag, a \fC<summary>\fP tag will be inserted with the
name of the subdirectory. If
.I macroname
is present, the name of the subdirectory will be prepended with the body of a
macro
.I macroname
(for example, this can be used to include custom
.SM SVG
markup as arrows).
.
.IP \n+[list].
After the \fC<summary>\fP tag a \fC<div>\fP tag will be inserted into
\fC<details>\fP, containing the concatenated output from processing each of the
.I .slw
files inside that subdirectory in reverse lexicographical order, in a manner
similar to the
.I include
directive. (See

.IR timestamp_format .
.
.IP \[bu]
.BR ext-in-permalink .
If set to \[lq]0\[rq], permalinks generated by the
